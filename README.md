# PDF Question Helper: A Beginner's Project

Welcome to **PDF Question Helper**, a simple app that allows users to upload a PDF, extract its text, and ask questions about the document using ChatGPT! This project is designed to help beginners learn how to integrate front-end, back-end, and third-party APIs.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Upload a PDF file to extract its text content.
- Ask ChatGPT questions about the PDF's content.
- Simple React frontend and Express backend setup.
- Integration with `pdf-parse` and OpenAI API.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### Setup

Before we get started with coding, we need to install a few dependencies. 

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side or outside a web browser. It comes pre-packaged with npm, a package manager that allows developers to install open-source libraries and modules. You can install Node.js from [this website](https://nodejs.org/). 

After installation, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

For this project, we also need an API key to communicate with the OpenAI API. An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests made to an API (Application Programming Interface). We will provide the API key in your application or scripts when making requests to OpenAI's API.

Sign up for an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup). Navigate to the API Keys section in your OpenAI dashboard and click Create New Secret Key to generate a new API key. Copy the API key and save it securely. (You won't be able to see it again once you close the window.)

### Setting Up the React Frontend

`create-react-app` is a popular tool to bootstrap React applications. It sets up a new React project with all the essential configurations and tools pre-installed, so you can start coding immediately without hassle.


1. **Create a React app**:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app client
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
3. Install Axios for making API requests:
   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```
4. Replace your `App.js` file with the following snippet for file upload and question-asking functionality:

   ```javascript
   const handleFileUpload = async (event) => {
       const file = event.target.files[0];
       const formData = new FormData();
       formData.append('file', file);

       try {
           const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5001/upload', formData, {
               headers: {
                   'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'
               }
           });
           setPdfText(response.data.text);
       } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error uploading file:', error);
       }
   };

   const handleAskQuestion = async () => {
       try {
           const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5001/ask', {
               question,
               pdfText
           });
           setAnswer(response.data.answer);
       } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error asking question:', error);
       }
   };
   ```

5. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

---

### 2. Setting Up the Express Backend

1. Navigate back to the root directory and create the server folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir server && cd server
   ```
2. Initialize a Node.js project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install express multer pdf-parse openai
   ```
4. Create a file `index.js` and add the following code for handling PDF uploads and ChatGPT integration:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const multer = require('multer');
   const pdfParse = require('pdf-parse');
   const { OpenAI } = require('openai');

   const app = express();
   const upload = multer();
   const openai = new OpenAI('YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY');

   app.use(express.json());

   app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
       try {
           const data = await pdfParse(req.file.buffer);
           res.json({ text: data.text });
       } catch (error) {
           res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to parse PDF' });
       }
   });

   app.post('/ask', async (req, res) => {
       const { question, pdfText } = req.body;
       try {
           const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
               model: "gpt-4o-mini",
               messages: [{ role: "user", content: `${pdfText}\n\nQ: ${question}\nA:` }],
               store: true,
               stream: true,
           });

           let answer = '';
           for await (const chunk of stream) {
               answer += chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "";
           }

           res.json({ answer });
       } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error with OpenAI API:', error);
           res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to get response from OpenAI' });
       }
   });

   app.listen(5001, () => console.log('Server running on http://localhost:5001'));
   ```

5. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## üí° How It Works

### 1. Upload PDF
When a user uploads a PDF file, the backend processes it with `pdf-parse` to extract the text content.

**Backend Code**:
```javascript
app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const data = await pdfParse(req.file.buffer);
        res.json({ text: data.text });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to parse PDF' });
    }
});
```

### 2. Ask a Question
The user asks a question about the PDF's content, which is sent to the OpenAI API to generate a response.

**Backend Code**:
```javascript
app.post('/ask', async (req, res) => {
    const { question, pdfText } = req.body;
    try {
        const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
            model: "gpt-4o-mini",
            messages: [{ role: "user", content: `${pdfText}\n\nQ: ${question}\nA:` }],
            store: true,
            stream: true,
        });

        let answer = '';
        for await (const chunk of stream) {
            answer += chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "";
        }

        res.json({ answer });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to get response from OpenAI' });
    }
});
```

## üìù Notes for Beginners

1. **Creating a React App**: Use `npx create-react-app <app-name>` to quickly bootstrap a React project.
2. **Backend and Frontend Communication**: Use Axios to send HTTP requests between React and Express.
3. **API Integration**: Learn how to integrate third-party libraries like `pdf-parse` and APIs like OpenAI.
4. **Error Handling**: Always include try-catch blocks to manage errors gracefully.

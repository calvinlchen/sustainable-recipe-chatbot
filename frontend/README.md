## ðŸ“Œ Overview  

The **Sustainable Recipe Generator** is a web application that generates **eco-friendly recipes** based on user preferences.  

Users can specify:  
- **Dietary choices** (Vegan, Keto, etc.)  
- **Budget constraints** (Low, Medium, High)  
- **Dietary restrictions** (Gluten-free, Halal, etc.)  
- **Health goals** (Weight loss, Muscle gain, etc.)  

The app then generates **three recipes** that reuse ingredients to minimize **food waste**, prioritizing **seasonal, locally sourced ingredients**.
